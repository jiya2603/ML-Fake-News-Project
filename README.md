# üì∞ Fake News Prediction System

This project is a simple yet effective machine learning model that predicts whether a news article is real or **fake**. It uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to preprocess text data and a **Logistic Regression** classifier for binary classification.

## üöÄ Features

- Text preprocessing using **NLTK** (stopword removal, stemming)
- Feature extraction using **TF-IDF Vectorization**
- Model training and evaluation using **Logistic Regression**
- Accuracy evaluation using **scikit-learn** metrics
